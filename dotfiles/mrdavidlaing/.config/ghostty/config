# Ghostty configuration with conditional base loading
#
# Note: `config-file` entries are loaded after the file they're defined in,
# so we load base configs first, then personal overrides last.

# Try Omarchy base config (only exists on Omarchy Linux)
config-file = ?"~/.local/share/omarchy/config/ghostty/config"

# Try omarchy-compat base config (only exists on macOS/Arch)
config-file = ?"~/.local/share/omarchy-compat/ghostty/config"

# Personal overrides (all platforms)
config-file = ?"~/.config/ghostty/overrides.conf"
