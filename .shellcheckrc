# Enable all optional checks
enable=all

# Disable specific checks that may not be relevant for our use case
# SC1090/SC1091: Can't follow non-constant source / Not following sourced files
# SC2154: Referenced but not assigned (common in test frameworks like ShellSpec)
# SC2317: Command appears to be unreachable (common in test mock functions)
# SC2250: Prefer putting braces around variable references (style preference)
# SC2292: Prefer [[ ]] over [ ] for tests (style preference for tests)
# SC2155: Declare and assign separately (common pattern in tests)
# SC2164: Use 'cd ... || exit' (not critical in test setup)
# SC2034: Variable appears unused (common in test variables)
# SC2312: Command substitution masking return values (style warning, often intentional)
# SC2249: Consider adding default case (informational, not always needed)
# SC2016: Single quotes don't expand (often intentional for literals)
# SC2181: Check exit code directly (style preference)
# SC2178/SC2184: Array/string variable usage (often intentional in logging)
# SC1003: Single quote escaping (informational)
